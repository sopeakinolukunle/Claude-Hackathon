## Key Features Explained

### Brand Voice Calibration
Upload 1-3 examples of your existing content (text, images, or both). Claude analyzes:
- **Text Content**:
  - Writing tone (conversational, professional, data-driven, etc.)
  - Style characteristics (paragraph length, structure, formatting)
  - Key terminology and industry jargon
  - Content structure patterns
- **Visual Content** (if images provided):
  - Visual style and design aesthetic
  - Color schemes and palettes
  - Typography choices
  - Layout and composition patterns

This analysis is then applied to all generated content to maintain consistency across both text and visuals.

### AI Image Generation (SVG)
The system automatically detects when you want images and generates them directly:
- **Keyword Detection**: Mentions of "image", "visual", "graphic", "illustration", etc.
- **Brand Voice Images**: If you upload images during brand voice calibration
- **Smart Generation**:
  - Generate image only (e.g., "create an image of a tech startup office")
  - Generate image + content (e.g., "blog post about AI with an image")
  - Generate content only (default when no image keywords detected)

**How it works:**
1. Claude analyzes your topic and brand voice (including visual style from uploaded images)
2. Claude generates professional SVG (vector graphics) code
3. The image is rendered directly in your content
4. SVG images are:
   - **Scalable** - Look perfect at any size
   - **Lightweight** - Fast loading
   - **Editable** - Can be customized in design tools
   - **Professional** - Perfect for marketing materials

**Benefits:**
- ✅ No extra API keys or services needed
- ✅ Images appear instantly in the application
- ✅ Professional, scalable vector graphics
- ✅ Matches your brand's visual style automatically
- ✅ 100% Claude-powered solution

### Multi-Format Generation
Generate multiple content types simultaneously:
- **Blog Posts**: 800-1200 words, SEO-optimized
- **LinkedIn Posts**: 3 posts with varying angles (thought leadership, stats-focused, question-based)
- **Twitter Posts**: 5 bite-sized insights
- **Google Ads**: 3 variations for A/B testing

### Brand Consistency Scoring
Each generated piece receives a consistency score (0-100%) based on:
- Use of brand-specific terminology
- Tone matching
- Style adherence
